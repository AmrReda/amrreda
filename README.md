- Work extensively with **.NET / ASP.NET Core**, REST, background workers, and messaging
- Architect and operate systems on **AWS & Azure** (serverless, containers, CI/CD)
- Migrate and modernise legacy systems into clean, maintainable architectures
- Lead technical delivery, mentor engineers, and raise engineering standards
